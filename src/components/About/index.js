      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img alt="Headshot" src={require("./Headshot.jpg")} width='40%' className='headshot'/>            
      <p>Welcome, I am happy to have you here! My name is Haley and I currently live in Seattle, WA (where I was born and raised). I am a full-stack web developer with 6+ years of experience as a licensed healthcare professional. I would like to grow a career in the tech industry that incorporates my extensive background in Sports Medicine, healthcare, and fitness. I am interested in an ambitious and passionate role that allows me to contribute my solution-focused and innovative mindset. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>I recently obtained my web development coding certificate through the University of Washingtonâ€™s full-time MERN program. I have enjoyed developing skills in React, Javascript, Express, MySql, MongoDB, Node.js and look forward to growing my wealth of knowledge! Please visit my portfolio section to find samples of my work. Throughout class I led three teams of classmates in creation of apps: a React app with a MySql server that allows users to set and track self-care goals, a Node.js and Handlebars platform for book lovers to interact with full CRUD functionality and RESTful routes, and a front-end app that features an activity generator using two third-party APIs and a journal using local storage.</p> 
      <br/>
      <p>Former colleagues would describe me as their go-to for problem solving, superuser of our electronic medical record, being known for my attention to detail, integrity, adaptability and leadership. I am an experienced communicator as a teacher, presenter, and patient-care provider. My thirst to always be learning, passion for excellence, comfort in a fast-paced environment, internal drive and commitment to deliver results make me the ideal candidate for a quality-focused Junior Software Developer position. I am looking for a challenging role within a company that is spirited, driven to succeed, and offers opportunities for growth.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I am a BOC Certified Athletic Trainer and am licensed to practice in the state of Washington by the Department of Health. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training from Chapman University. In February 2022 I ended employment of over 6 years at Seattle Children's Hospital. During that time I was the head Athletic Trainer at The Bush School, lead for our CPR program, Cystic Fibrosis Exercise Specialist, and one of the first Athletic Trainers in a brand new role that brought Athletic Trainers into the Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Clinic.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>My hobbies include innovation, volunteer coaching for Girls on The Run Puget Sound, country music, sports medicine, hiking, soccer, Peloton, reading, spending time with friends/family, and interior design. I am a member of ATPPS, NATA and the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.</p>
